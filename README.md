- Enhance the decision-making process with interactive dashboards.

## Data Analysis Methodology

1. **Business Problem Understanding**:  
   - Gathered insights from stakeholders to understand key objectives and requirements.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:  
   - Conducted a thorough EDA using **Power Query** and **SQL** to explore the data, identify patterns, and summarize key findings.

3. **Ad-Hoc Analysis**:  
   - Performed ad-hoc data analysis using **SQL** queries to answer specific business questions.

## Data Set Overview

This project utilizes data from two primary databases: `trips_db` and `targets_db`. These databases contain detailed and aggregated data on Goodcabs' operations, including trip information, passenger behavior, city-specific performance, and monthly targets for growth. 

### trips_db
This database stores detailed and aggregated data on trips, passenger types, and repeat trip behavior across Goodcabsâ€™ operations in tier-2 cities. The data is organized by city, month, and day type (weekday or weekend) for comprehensive analysis of travel patterns, demographics, and repeat usage trends.

1. **dim_city**
   - Purpose: Provides city-specific details for location-based analysis of trips and passenger behavior.

     - `city_id`: Unique city identifier (e.g., RJ01 for Jaipur).
     - `city_name`: City name (e.g., Jaipur, Lucknow).

2. **dim_date**
   - Purpose: Provides date-specific details for time-based grouping and analysis of trip patterns across days, months, and weekends vs weekdays.
   - Key Columns: 
     - `date`: The specific date of the entry (YYYY-MM-DD).
     - `start_of_month`: The first day of the respective month.
     - `month_name`: Name of the month.

     - `city_id`: City identifier.
     - `total_passengers`: Total count of all passengers.
     - `new_passengers`: Count of new passengers.
     - `repeat_passengers`: Count of repeat passengers.

4. **dim_repeat_trip_distribution (Aggregated Data)**
   - Purpose: Provides a breakdown of repeat trip behavior, categorized by trip frequency (up to 10 trips per month) for each city.
   - Key Columns:
     - `month`: Start date of the month.
     - `city_id`: City identifier.
     - `trip_count`: Number of trips taken by repeat passengers.
     - `repeat_passenger_count`: Count of repeat passengers for each trip frequency.

5. **fact_trips**
   - Purpose: Provides detailed trip-level data, including distance, fare, and ratings for each trip.
   - Key Columns:
     - `trip_id`: Unique trip identifier.
     - `date`: Date of the trip.
     - `city_id`: City identifier.
     - `passenger_type`: New or repeat passenger.
     - `distance_travelled (km)`: Distance of the trip in kilometers.
     - `fare_amount`: Fare amount paid.
     - `passenger_rating`: Passenger rating (1-10).
     - `driver_rating`: Driver rating (1-10).

### targets_db
This database contains monthly targets for each city, including trip counts, new passenger acquisition, and average passenger ratings. It helps in evaluating Goodcabs' performance against the company's established goals.

1. **city_target_passenger_rating**
   - Purpose: Stores target average passenger ratings for each city.
   - Key Columns:
     - `city_id`: Unique city identifier.
     - `target_avg_passenger_rating`: Target average passenger rating.

2. **monthly_target_new_passengers**
   - Purpose: Stores the target number of new passengers to acquire for each city in a given month.
   - Key Columns:
